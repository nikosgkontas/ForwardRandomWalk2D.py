Visualizing a 2D Forward Random Walk. 
<br>
<br>
This script simulates and visualizes a 2D forward random walk with 100,000 steps. Starting from the origin, the walker moves one step forward along the x-axis and randomly chooses to step up or down along the y-axis with equal probability. The resulting path is plotted to display the random nature of the walk, showing the fluctuations in the y-position over time.
